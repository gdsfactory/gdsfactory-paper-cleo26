  abstract      = {Computer-aided design (CAD) has become a critical element in the creation of nanopatterned structures and devices. In particular, with the increased adoption of easy-to-learn programming languages like python, there has been a significant rise in the amount of lithographic geometries generated through scripting and programming. However, there are currently unaddressed gaps in usability for open-source CAD tools--especially those in the GDSII design space--that prevent wider adoption by scientists and students who might otherwise benefit from scripted design. For example, constructing relations between adjacent geometries is often much more difficult than necessary--spacing a resonator structure a few micrometers from a readout structure often requires manually coding the placement arithmetic. While inconveniences like these can be overcome by writing custom functions, they are often significant barriers to entry for new users or those less familiar with programming. To help streamline the design process and reduce barrier to entry for scripting designs, we have developed PHIDL, an open-source GDSII-based CAD tool for python.},

However, the exploration process is a complex task given the plethora of design choices such as the selection of components, number of components, operating modes of each of the components, connections between the components and variety of ways in which the same functionality can be implemented. To tackle these issues, scripts are used to generate designs based on high-level abstract constructions. Still, this approach is usually ad hoc and platform dependent, making the whole procedure hardly reusable, scalable and versatile. We propose a generic, open-source framework tackling rapid design exploration for the generation of modular and parametric electronic designs that is able to work on any major simulator.},

The system has demonstrated success at trapping and maintaining both single ions and cold crystals of ions. We achieve this by fabricating our own custom surface Paul traps in the UMass Amherst cleanroom facilities, which are then argon ion milled, diced, mounted and wire bonded to an interposer which is placed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber and baked in a conventional oven for 46 hours. We demonstrate the system's ability to confine strontium ions and present preliminary data towards calibrating the ion trap parameters for reduced heating rates. Future work will see the system being used to study the effects of various trap geometries, process fabrication steps and surface treatments on anomalous heating rates, and for portable quantum sensing applications, as an optical atomic clock.},

Many hyperparameter search algorithms have been proposed for improving the efficiency of model selection, however their adaptation to the distributed compute environment is often ad-hoc. We propose Tune, a unified framework for model selection and training that provides a narrow-waist interface between training scripts and search algorithms. We show that this interface meets the requirements for a broad range of hyperparameter search algorithms, allows straightforward scaling of search to large clusters, and simplifies algorithm implementation. We demonstrate the implementation of several state-of-the-art hyperparameter search algorithms in Tune. Tune is available at http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tune.html.},

While an open-source ethos currently exists within some quantum technologies, especially in quantum computer programming, we argue that there are additional advantages in developing open quantum hardware (OQH). Open quantum hardware encompasses open-source software for the control of quantum devices in labs, blueprints and open-source toolkits for chip design and other hardware components, as well as openly-accessible testbeds and facilities that allow cloud-access to a wider scientific community. We provide an overview of current projects in the OQH ecosystem, identify gaps, and make recommendations on how to close them today.

  abstract      = {Electronic circuit designers commonly start their design process with a schematic, namely an abstract representation of the physical circuit. In integrated photonics on the other hand, it is common for the design to begin at the physical component level, and create a layout by connecting components with interconnects. In this paper, we discuss how to create a schematic from the physical layout via netlist extraction, which enables circuit simulations. Post-layout extraction can also be used to predict how fabrication variability and non-uniformity will impact circuit performance. This is based on the component position information, compact models that are parameterized for dimensional variations, and manufacturing variability models such as a simulated wafer thickness map. This final step is critical in understanding how real-world silicon photonic circuits will behave. We present an example based on treating the ring resonator as a circuit. A silicon photonics design kit, as described here, is available for download at http://github.com/lukasc-ubc/SiEPIC\_EBeam\_PDK.},

Favorable scaling with the system size and the number of computed bands is exhibited. We propose a new effective dielectric tensor for anisotropic structures, and demonstrate that O(\ensuremath{\Delta}x2) convergence can be achieved even in systems with sharp material discontinuities. We show how it is possible to solve for interior eigenvalues, such as localized defect modes, without computing the many underlying eigenstates. Preconditioned conjugate-gradient Rayleigh-quotient minimization is compared with the Davidson method for eigensolution, and a number of iteration variants and preconditioners are characterized.

There may be some differences such as number of inputs, width/length of shapes used for their construction. There groups of cells can be defined and implemented by their master, set of parameters describing the difference in behavior between variants, and the code that implemented the master. As an example an S-Bend can be defined as a PCell with parameters describing the bend radius, height, waveguide width, etc; and with the code relating the parameters to actual implementation. Although it is very common to have a PCell based on physical design of a component; the logical design, schematic and/or symbol, representation of a component can be parameterized. In this chapter, we use an S-Bend to examine a PCell implementation and also describe some related topics such as public APIs used for waveguide generation and component description format (CDF).},

As a result, the associated design methodologies are also evolving from component-oriented design to a more circuit-oriented design flow, that makes abstraction from the very detailed geometry and enables design on a larger scale. In this paper, the state of this emerging photonic circuit design flow and its synergies with electronic design automation (EDA) are reviewed. The design flow from schematic capture, circuit simulation, layout and verification is covered. The similarities and the differences between photonic and electronic design, and the challenges and opportunities that present themselves in the new photonic design landscape, such as variability analysis, photonic-electronic co-simulation and compact model definition are discussed.},

In this approach, all steps in the workflow are based on a single high-level definition of the component, in a Python script. Because there is only one description, the design flow becomes less error prone due to incorrect definitions, and the overall reproducibility is greatly improved. Furthermore it enables easy closed-loop modeling of components and circuits. Also, previous work can easily be built upon because lower level blocks can seamlessly be replaced by new blocks. While we illustrate the application in photonics, this software and the used design patterns can be extended to other domains such as RF design and to multidomain physics such as opto-electronics.},

It has been around for decades, but in recent years, it has gained traction as electronic design challenges increase drastically with their atomic-level limitations. Silicon photonics has made significant advancements during this period, but there are many obstacles without an acceptable level of comfort as seen by the lack of semiconductor community involvement. Apart from a series of technological barriers, such as extreme fabrication sensitivity, inefficient light generation on-chip, etc., there are also certain design challenges. In this chapter, we will discuss the challenges and the opportunities in photonic integrated circuit design software tools, examine existing design flows for photonics design and how these fit different design styles, and review the activities in collaboration and standardization efforts to improve design flows.},
